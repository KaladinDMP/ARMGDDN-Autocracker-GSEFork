ARMGDDN Autocracker is a cutting-edge tool designed to revolutionize the way you crack and prepare Steam games for an unparalleled gaming experience. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, ARMGDDN Autocracker empowers gamers and enthusiasts to effortlessly unlock the full potential of their favorite games. 

**WARNING:** This is not a tool for amateurs but rather a tool to make the methods easier for those with a general knowledge of these techniques. You will still need to find the EXE that needs its Steam stub removed, the Steam API DLL that needs cracking, and know when and where a Cold Client Loader or a VD bat is needed.

## ‚ú® Features

### üñ±Ô∏è Context Menu Integration
ARMGDDN Autocracker seamlessly integrates with your Windows Explorer, offering convenient context menu commands for both EXE and DLL files.
**EXE Files:**
 - **ARMGDDN Autocracker:** A menu for all the EXE features in case you want to use more than one option.
 - **ARMGDDN Cold Client:** Prepare your Steam game for use with the Cold Clien Loader.
 - **ARMGDDN Steam Stub Remover:** Effortlessly check for and remove Steam stubs from your game EXEs.
 - **ARMGDDN VD Batmaker:** Generate VD bat files optimized for Virtual Desktop owners (VR ONLY).
**DLL Files:**
 - **ARMGDDN Autocracker:** Automatically replace the original DLL file (steam_api64.dll or steam_api.dll) with the experimental generic Goldberg Steam emulator.

### üñ±Ô∏è Drag and Drop Support
In addition to the optional context menu options, ARMGDDN Autocracker supports intuitive drag and drop functionality. Simply drag and drop your EXE or DLL file onto the main executable to initiate the cracking process.  You can only do EXE fixes to EXEs, and DLL fixes on the steam_api DLLs (meaning you can't do both from one drag and drop or one right click context menu).

### üîç Steam App ID Detection
ARMGDDN Autocracker intelligently searches for the steam_appid.txt file in the directory of the dropped file. If found, it automatically copies the file to the appropriate location. If the steam_appid.txt file is not detected, ARMGDDN Autocracker prompts you to enter the game name using the ARMGDDN.App.ID utility. In case the app ID is still not found, you have the flexibility to enter it manually.

### üîì Comprehensive Cracking
With ARMGDDN Autocracker's gentle nudging, you can effortlessly crack any game with basic Steam DRM. Say goodbye to the need for additional tools or complex procedures and enjoy a seamless gaming experience.

## üìñ Usage

1. Extract ARMGDDN Autocracker to its new "forever home".

2. To use the context menu commands:
  - Install the context menu options by running ContextMenuRegEdits.exe from the parent directory as an administrator. There's a fast way to safely remove them as well.
  - Alternatively, you can use the drag and drop functionality to avoid modifying the registry.
  - Right-click on an EXE file and select the desired option from the ARMGDDN Autocracker context submenu.
  - Right-click on a steam_api64.dll or steam_api.dll and select the "ARMGDDN Autocracker" option.
  - Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the cracking process.

3. To use the drag and drop functionality:
  - Drag and drop an EXE or DLL file onto the ARMGDDN Main executable.
  - Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the cracking process.

4. If the steam_appid.txt file is not automatically detected, ARMGDDN Autocracker will prompt you to enter the game name using the ARMGDDN.App.ID utility. As a fallback, you can enter it manually.

5. Enjoy your cracked games and embark on thrilling adventures!
