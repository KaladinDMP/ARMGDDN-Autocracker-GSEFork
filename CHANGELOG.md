# ARMGDDN Autocracker Changelog

Welcome to the ARMGDDN Autocracker Changelog! Here, we chronicle the thrilling journey of our beloved program as it evolves and grows. Get ready for a wild ride filled with bug fixes, new features, and the occasional twist and turn!

## **v1.0.1 - 6/11/2024**
Hold onto your hats, folks! v1.0.1 is here, and it's packed with more fixes than a handyman's toolbox!

**Highlights**
- We've given our exe files a fresh coat of paint and updated their version numbers. They're now ready to take on the world!
- ARMGDDN.Main, ARMGDDN.Cold.Client, and ARMGDDN.Autocracker have undergone some serious therapy to resolve their appid issues. No more falling back on old habits!
- Steam_appid.txts with old app id's have been shown the door. Out with the old, in with the new!
- We've tidied up the clears and pauses to make the flow as smooth as a baby's bottom. Readability is key, folks!
- Installing and removing context menu reg edits now come with a friendly warning about the talking. Adjust your volume accordingly, unless you enjoy surprises!
- Steamclient files in the Api folder have been given their marching orders. They weren't pulling their weight anyway.
- We've embraced the power of three and switched to the more common 3-number version code (X.X.X). Who needs that extra X anyway?

**Behind the Scenes**
- RAW files have been updated, and a shiny new dev branch has been created. It's like a secret hideout for all the cool stuff that didn't make it into the release version.
- We're dreaming big with plans for a database of games and non-games. Imagine a world where everyone contributes to a shared knowledge base, making the app faster and smarter! Also planning on a fork for [GSE fork](https://github.com/otavepto/gbe_fork) compatibility
